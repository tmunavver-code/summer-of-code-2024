# Frontend Development : Week 5

With the completion of week 4, we have successfully developed both the admin and cashier portals, culminating in the creation of our robust platform. Now, it is time to make it accessible to the public. Our final task is to deploy our website, ensuring its availability for widespread usage and seamless user experience.

### Task - Deployment

The simplest way to deploy your website can be using `github-pages`. The resources below give a step-by-step guide to deploy your website. You can try any one of the methods for deployment.

Another platform that you can use for deployment is `azure`. All students enrolled at IIT Delhi (or any other educational institute) are eligible for a free Microsoft Azure account. Follow the steps to create your account.

### Bonus Task - Integrating the ML model

- _This task is for those who are doing both ML and Frontend_.

  Your task is to integrate the Machine learning model with the frontend of the website. The data is not available entirely for your model, however there will be brownie points if you can show your model's output for dummy points that you make. Try integrating the optimum pricing model, which adjusts prices according to the current market scenarios. There are several resources available online for this, read more about this.
